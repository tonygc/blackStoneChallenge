The directory named "server" has the API working with the express js and mongoose package for MongoDB.
The database is hosted in MLab allowing all access.
Execute "npm i" for download all package plugins, after "npm start". The api will run at port 3000.

The directory named "client" has graphic interface.
I used material-ui and axios to connect with API.
You shall execute "npm i" first to download all package and before "npm start". The app will run at port 4000.
